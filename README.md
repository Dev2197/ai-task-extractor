2. **Run Backend & Frontend**

   You'll need two terminal windows to run the servers:

   **Terminal 1 - Backend Server:**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install

   # Create .env file in backend directory
   # Add your OpenAI API key and port (default 3001)
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   PORT=3001

   # Start the server
   npm run dev
   ```

   **Terminal 2 - Frontend Server:**

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install

   # Optional: Create .env file in client directory
   # By default, frontend will connect to http://localhost:3001
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001

   # Start the frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

   The application will be available at:
